#### App title : Dine web restaurant
### As aforementioned I present the app for booking meals, making reservations, editing both meals and reservations on a web restaurant
#### Usage: Just navigate on the links located on the top of the app. Some links are protected so in case You would like to enjoy all the app just register Your fabricated data, login and "play" the app.

#### Inspiration: Frontend Mentor https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges

### The app functionality on localhost works impeccable, but on vercel server erracitally, so don't be suprised slow server requests, especially as far as making reservations or adding orders are concerned
#### Planning for enhancing the app is to switch the vercel server on another one, more stable or just supabase
